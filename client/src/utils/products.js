      "This test is merely done to measure the level of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone quickly. This is one specific kind of pituitary hormone that stimulates the thyroid gland. This test is also necessary for everyone as thyroid disorders are also known for turning incurable if not detected or treated on time. The prime objective of this test is to determine that the thyroid gland is hyperactive or underactive. If you are having any kind of thyroid disorders, then your doctor may suggest you to go for a test. If the thyroid gland starts to produce huge amount of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone, then a specific health condition starts to occur that is known as hypothyroidism. No specific preparations are required for this test. You just need to follow the instructions of your doctor in a proper manner. The thyroid gland functionality remains different in every person, which impacts the test results. Besides, the test results may also vary depending upon age, gender or health condition.",

Measurement of free triiodothyronine is the prime reason why this test is run. Decreasing amount of FT4 may cause hypothyroidism, which may cause several types of disorders. FT4 is known for comprising a little fraction of total thyroxine that remains available to the body tissues. Free T3 and T4 blood tests are included in all kinds of FT4 tests. You must inform your doctor before the test if you are already on medication or having any kind of allergies. No other specific preparations are needed for these tests. However, 10-12 hours of complete fasting is necessary before appearing for the test. The test results may vary depending upon gender and age or the health condition of the patient.",
